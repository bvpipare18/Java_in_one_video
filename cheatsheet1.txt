53. Packages
    -   There are thousands of inbuilt classes.
    -   There are third party classes as well like JDBC,servlets.

    -   All these classes are present in different categories of Package.
        -   .io package --> BufferedInputSystem,File,PrintWriter
        -   .net package --> Socket,URL,ServerSocket
        -   .sql package --> ResultSet(Interface),DriverManager,TimeStamp

    -   Package name should be mirror of Domain name
        -   Domain Name --> google.com
        -   Package Name --> com.google

    -   com --> Telusko --> Test --> 4 class files
        -   In order to acces all 4 class files 
            com.Telusko.Test.*;
    
    -   To java files having same class name can be present in two different Package.

54. Access Modifiers
    -   In java we dont have Access Specifiers like CPP instead we use Access Modifiers.
    -   Abstract,Private,Protected,Public,Final

    -   Only Abstract,Final,Public can be used with the classes.

    -   Private,Protected can not be used with the classes.
    -   Only in case of Inner class we can use Private.

    -   Default class
        class A{

        }
    -   These ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘† class can be accessed only inside a same Package.

    -   Modifiers specified class
        public class A{

        }

    -   To Access class outside a package we must specify that class as 'public'

    -   We can also make Variable amd Methods as public,private,protected.
    -   By default it is a default it means we can not access outside the package to do that 
        we use 'public'.

    -   Private: Specific class
    -   Default: Specific Package
    -   Public: Any class or Package
    -   Protected: Subsiding class
            same package;
            public class A{
                protected int i;
            }

            class B extends A{
                System.out.println(i);
                // i can be used here
            }

    -	Default is also called package private.
